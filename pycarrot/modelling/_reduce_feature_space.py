    """
    Reduces the feature space used for model training
    by iteratively removing the feature with the smallest
    impact on model performance.

    Given an algorithm and metric, retrains models with
    one feature removed. Notes the metric when the weakest
    feature is removed and compares it with the acceptable
    loss threshold. If the threshold has not been reached
    the process is repeated.

    If a metric higher than the reference_metric is found,
    it is printed.

    Arguments
    ---------
    setup : Setup
        Dataclass containing the prepared data and further
        configurations.

    algorithm : str
        Algorithm to use for model training.

        Metric to use for evaluating model performance.

    reference_metric : float
        Metric value to use as baseline.

    acceptable_loss : float
        Acceptable loss threshold, e.g. 0.95. Once a value
        of acceptable_loss * reference_metric is undercut,
        the feature space reduction is reduced.
